My Famous “Emerald Ecstasy” Green Smoothie

(this is the Green Smoothie that I make at a show)

Put Ingredients into your Vitamix in the following order:

- 1 peeled orange
- 1/4 large Pineapple or 1/3 of a small Pineapple
- 1/2 large Banana
- 1/2 small Apple or 1/4 of a large one
- 2 big hand fulls of Spinach (at a show I add a touch of Kale and Parsley too)
- 2 cups of Ice

This will make 2-3 LARGE servings or 4-5 smaller (juice glass size) servings

Blend according to the instructions in my Fruit Juice section (until the icy slushy mixture turns into a smooth liquid). This is a “beginner” Green Smoothie. As you get used to the taste of the greens, you can increase the proportion of greens to fruit, try out some of the “stronger tasting greens” (remember, Spinach is one of the “magic veggies”), and use fruits that are not as sweet – like berries for instance.
